## Mandatory layer sequence for any formal output

```
0. deal-master                 — inventory existing work, route deal workflow
1. mckinsey-consultant         — frame the problem, govern methodology
2. analytical-operating-system — maintain evidence states, belief register, decision posture
3. market-research             — gather evidence (L4→L3→L2)
4. writing-style               — prose quality, claim tagging       ← AUTO
5. claim-scrutinizer           — seven-part claim test
6. red-team                    — adversarial pass
7. pre-mortem                  — failure mode inventory
8. pattern-docx / pptx         — produce the file
9. doc-quality-checker         — brand + QA gate                   ← AUTO
```

Not every output requires the full sequence. Step 0 applies to full deal workflows. Steps 4 and 9 are always mandatory when a formal file is produced.
Step 2 is mandatory for deal-master, IC memo, diligence, and investment thesis workflows.
Steps 5–7 are mandatory for IC memos and investment documents.

## Pipelines (multi-agent workflows)

| Pipeline | When to use | Mode flags |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `ic-memo-pipeline` | Full IC memo from intake to branded DOCX | `NTB_MODE`: full/skip · `KPI_MODE`: full/skip |
| `market-research-pipeline` | Standalone gold-standard market research report | — |

---

## Skills that always pair

| If you invoke... | Also load... |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `deal-master` | `mckinsey-consultant`, `analytical-operating-system` |
| `ic-memo-pipeline` | `mckinsey-consultant`, `analytical-operating-system` |
| `market-research` | `mckinsey-consultant`, `competitive-moat-assessment` (post-L2) |
| `ic-memo` | `ntb-diligence` (if NTB_MODE=full), `driver-tree`, `executive-summary-writer` (S2) |
| `driver-tree` | `boundability` (use load-bearing nodes as boundability units) |
| `pre-mortem` | `boundability` (pass 4c converts failure modes to underwriting actions) |
| `pattern-docx` | `doc-quality-checker` (auto-runs after file delivery) |
| `ntb-diligence` | `driver-tree` (maps NTBs to gating nodes) |
| `tam-sam-som-calculator` | `market-research` L4 (TAM/SAM sizing step) |

---

## Skills that are intentionally NOT paired

| Skip this... | When... | Why |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| `kpi-tree-builder` | Inside ic-memo-pipeline (pre-close) | Post-close only — don't build a KPI tree on pre-diligence assumptions |
| `market-research` L1 (company position) | IC memo mode | ic-memo intake + CIM already covers L1 — running it duplicates work |
| `writing-style` | Never skip | Always runs on formal output — skipping produces a draft, not a deliverable |

## ic-memo-pipeline — phase map

```
Phase 0   Domain template check
Phase 1   Intake → Gate 1
Phase 2   L4 market → L3 customer → L2 competitive → Moat assessment → Gate 2
Phase 3   NTB diligence (NTB_MODE=full)
Phase 3b  Driver tree
Phase 4   S1 → [S3/S4/S5/S6/S7/S8 parallel] → S9 → S10 → S2 (exec summary last)
Phase 5   Pass 1 (writing-style) → Pass 2 (claim-scrutinizer) → Pass 3 (red-team)
          → Pass 4 (pre-mortem + numeric reconciliation) → Pass 4c (boundability) → Gate 3
Phase 6   Output (pattern-docx)
Phase 7   QA gate (doc-quality-checker) → Gate 4
Phase 8   KPI tree (KPI_MODE=full) — post-close, no gate
